  Teaching has been a steady companion in my learning journey. I don’t claim to be an expert —
  I just enjoy understanding things deeply and sharing what I learn along the way. 
  It keeps me curious, grounded, and constantly learning.

<p>
  I also served as a <strong>teaching aid</strong> for the Deep Learning Cohort at <strong>TalentSprint</strong>,
  supporting the module on <strong>TinyML</strong>. This was a unique hands-on program created for
  <strong>working professionals and industry engineers</strong> exploring practical deployment of ML on
  resource-constrained hardware.
</p>

<p>
  Over the past few years, we have conducted this program <strong>across more than five cohorts</strong>,
  entirely <strong>online</strong>. Working with hardware remotely made it both challenging and deeply meaningful.
  Together with <strong>Banhimitra Kundu</strong>, and under the guidance of  
  <strong>Prof. Chetan Singh Thakur</strong>, we supported <strong>over 60 participants</strong> per cohort as they
  navigated real-time debugging, setup issues, and hands-on experimentation from a distance.
</p>

<p>
  Supporting learners from diverse backgrounds, across different time hardware environments,
  taught me a great deal about patience, clarity in communication, and designing learning experiences
  that stay grounded in practicality and simplicity.

<p>
  At <strong>Vidyakosha</strong>, I work with <strong>undergraduate students</strong> on developing a strong
  foundation in embedded systems, sensing technologies, and hardware–software co-design. The focus
  has been on building practical understanding rather than textbook definitions.
</p>

<p>
  I help teach concepts such as <strong>microcontroller programming</strong>, sensor integration,
  communication protocols, and deploying ML models on microcontrollers. One of the core themes has
  been learning to program through the lens of <strong>compute and power awareness</strong> — understanding
  why efficiency matters and how engineering choices shape system behavior in the real world.
</p>

<p>
  These sessions are hands-on and exploratory, where students learn by building small systems,
  experimenting, and debugging together. It has been a meaningful experience to watch young
  engineers grow confident with hardware and discover the joy of building.

<p>
  I have also been associated with the <strong>Centre for Advanced Learning (CFAL)</strong> in Mangalore,
  serving in different supportive roles over the years. My time there shaped a significant part of my
  thinking about education and learning.
</p>

<p>
  I worked as an <strong>Makerspace Coordinator</strong> and later as a <strong>Academic Coordinator</strong>,
  where I helped develop hands-on learning environments that encouraged students to explore technology
  through <strong>robotics education</strong>, <strong>early coding exposure</strong>, electronics projects,
  and open-ended tinkering activities. The focus was on learning by building, experimenting, and understanding
  concepts beyond textbooks and exam preparation.
</p>

<p>
  Supporting teachers and students in these programs taught me a great deal about pacing, clarity,
  and empathy in education. More than anything, CFAL helped me understand the value of curiosity-driven
  learning and the importance of creating environments where students feel free to explore rather than
  perform.

<p style="margin-top:2rem; font-size:0.9rem; color:var(--text-muted); text-align:center;">
  Teaching has never been about achievement for me — it’s simply a way to stay curious, learn deeply, and contribute in a small way wherever I can.

    <p>
      Hi, I’m <strong>Adithya M D</strong>.
      Like most confused engineers at graduation, I wasn’t exactly sure what I was supposed to do next.
      While many of my classmates made sensible, stable choices and took corporate jobs,
      I somehow convinced myself it would be a great idea to try solving real problems in the real world
      (read: willingly signing up for chaos).
    </p>

    <p>
      I worked with a few startups early on, and eventually co-founded a small venture with my
      friend <strong>Shreyas Kulur</strong>. We ended up building a <strong>moisture meter</strong> 
      for the cashew processing industry  not because we planned to, but because we kept meeting
      processors who were genuinely struggling with moisture control and we thought,
      “How hard could it be?” (Answer: harder than we imagined.)
      Over time, the device quietly found its way into <strong>100+ processing units</strong>
      across India and parts of Africa — mostly through word of mouth and people actually finding it useful.
      
    </p>

    <p>
      Today, I work as a <strong>Senior Project Associate</strong> at the
      <strong>Indian Institute of Science (IISc)</strong>, where I explore technologies like
      <strong>embedded ML</strong>, <strong>audio and vision sensors</strong>, and
      other things . I’ve been fortunate to collaborate with research teams and 
      industries that care about building systems that survive the real world not just simulations.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m also working on an  project around <strong>insect monitoring and analysis</strong>.
      Once we have strong field results, I’ll share more details — currently, we’re somewhere between
      “promising prototype” and “why is this system behaving like that?”
    </p>

    <h2>A slow transition into Machine Learning</h2>
    <p>
      My interest in <strong>data science and machine learning</strong> didn’t start because of hype,
      trends, or motivational reels. It started because dealing with sensor noise and messy real-world data
      broke my brain. Collecting moisture data from different <strong>factories, godowns, and dockyards</strong>
      taught me more about modelling and uncertainty than any textbook.
    </p>

    <p>
      That experience made something obvious: rules and intuition stop working when reality gets messy.
      Data and mathematical reasoning helped make sense of what was actually happening — and that naturally
      pulled me toward exploring how <strong>embedded systems and ML</strong> can work together,
      especially through <strong>TinyML</strong>, <strong>signal processing</strong>,
      and <strong>edge inference</strong> on hardware that does not have the luxury of GPUs.
    </p>

    <h2>Teaching & Learning</h2>
    <p>
      I genuinely enjoy teaching. There’s no better way to discover what you *don’t* understand
      than trying to explain it confidently to a room full of people. 😄
    </p>

    <p>
      I’ve been a <strong>Teaching Assistant</strong> for:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Hardware Acceleration & Optimization for Machine Learning (IISc)</li>
      <li>Mathematical Foundations for Machine Learning (NPTEL)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Just to clarify before assumptions take flight:
      I have <strong>no grand plans of climbing the academic ladder</strong> or becoming a professor someday.
      I don’t teach for a résumé; I teach simply because I <strong>genuinely enjoy it</strong>.
      Watching concepts click and seeing people build meaningful things is extremely satisfying.
    </p>

    <h2>Where I am now</h2>
    <p>
      I’m still learning, building, breaking things, fixing them, occasionally breaking them again,
      and documenting the journey here. Everything on this site is a <strong>work in progress</strong> —
      my latest understanding, guaranteed to evolve, improve, or be completely replaced once I
      realise what I missed the first time.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top:1rem; color:#555;">
      If anything here resonates, or if you’re building something interesting,
      I’d love to connect.
